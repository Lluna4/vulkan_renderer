This is a prototype for a game engine im doing, its very messy and imperfect, but its a working vulkan renderer (and an small minigame that doesnt work yet) made in c++23 that works in basically any system that supports vulkan (with some changes to the CMakeLists.txt file)

I'm learning while writing this so expect some bad practices and weird stuff!
